    /// WHY THE ROLLBACK IS NOT "UNDO"  (2026-09-26, 实测推翻了原来的落法)
    ///
    /// docs/WIKI.md 记的落法是「应用 → 读 diff → 批量 undo，撤销栈是现成的」。**那句话是错的**，
    /// 而错法很具体：撤销栈管的是设计师的 command，而写动词的很大一部分写在 command 之外。
    /// 拿 15 个动词在 aapp320 上跑同一套判据（save → dry-run → save，比 sha256），结果分成两半：
    ///
    ///   · 只动布局的四个（set_layout_attr / insert_at / nudge / fit_size）逐字节回得去；
    ///   · 其余全部留残留 —— set_spec_attr 只多一个 status="u"（节点被摸过的标记），
    ///     rename_component / add_widget / set_local_string / set_excluded / convert_widget
    ///     各留各的，而 add_field / field_add 留下的是 UICreator 直接建进模型的那批规格节点
    ///     （.tsd 里多出 &lt;field name="apca_t.apcaent"&gt;、&lt;sfield name="lbl_apcaent"&gt;
    ///     和一条 TBinding，.bdx 跟着长）。UICreator 是工厂不是命令，它那半边从来没有进过撤销栈。
    ///
    /// 所以回滚不能建在撤销栈上，除非愿意接受"dry-run 有时改了你的表单还不说"。这里换成一条
    /// **构造上就精确**的路：
    ///
    ///   ① 先把**当前模型**渲染成一份临时包（就是 save 做的三件事：.4fd / .tsd / .bdx）；
    ///   ② 跑动词；
    ///   ③ 从句柄上把会话摘掉，再**从那份临时包重读回来**（句柄串不变）。
    ///
    /// 回滚因此是 reload —— 只是它读的不是盘上的源包（那会丢掉调用方**没保存**的改动），而是
    /// 调用前那一刻的渲染。这条路对每个动词都一样，不需要逐个动词证明，也不需要相信任何一半的
    /// 撤销栈。
    ///
    /// WHY THIS IS STILL HONEST ABOUT ITS COST
    ///
    /// 代价是真的，所以写在返回里，不藏着：会话被重建（loadMs 重新计、句柄回到 Loaded），模型
    /// 变成它**渲染出来**的那个样子（对每一份能通过语料定点判据的包，这与"没动过"是同一份字节
