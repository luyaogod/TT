    ///      indexer is what enforces whitelist-by-presence, same-value short-circuit, the
    ///      repeat/stepX/rowCount gating and the MinGrid* clamping, and it is what finally
    ///      invokes that command (XmlElement.cs:1888-1987). Calling the command directly skips
    ///      all of it -- P0 proved it writes attributes the element does not have.
    ///   2. A spec attribute is checked against the node's OWN materialised attribute set
    ///      before it is written. Edit.cs's `set` had no such check, which is how `case="upper"`
    ///      ended up in a .tsd where `case` means nothing.
    ///
    /// Both rules exist because the failure mode is identical and silent: a write that "works"
    /// and puts a meaningless attribute in the file, which the designer then either ignores or
    /// round-trips forever.
    ///
